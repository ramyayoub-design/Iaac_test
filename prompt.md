## 2026-01-09
**Goal:**  
Build a CV & Docs replica using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript — printable A4 CV layout and a "docs to keep" overview page.

**Prompt:**  
Requested a static site that reproduces two screenshots: an A4-style CV layout and a "docs to keep" two-column page. The project should use only HTML/CSS/JS, be responsive, and include print-to-PDF support.

**Result / Notes:**  
Generated the base project structure, implemented the CV header, section framework, employment history content, the docs page grid, shared styling in `styles.css`, and light JS in `app.js`. Print/A4 styles and a print button were added. Further documentation files were created in Part 5.
